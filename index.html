                <h2>Sales Expertise</h2>
                <p>Our sales acumen allows us to script out the AI agent and teach it how to handle 
                    any objections or questions. From there we'll revise and iterate to make it as 
                    complete as possible.

                <h2>AI and Technical Skills</h2>
                <p>We are pioneers in the emerging AI industry, and are experts in prompt engineering. This
                    allows us to make the AI agent sound completely human and to ensure that it does its job
                    over the phone.

                    calendar appointments, to sending out emails or text messages, we create the backend 
                    framework so that you don't have to worry about it.

                <h2>Project Management</h2>
                <p>Once we release the AI agents out into the field, we will closely monitor them to
                    ensure they're working properly. If issues come up, we will be the first to know and
                    will promptly take action to fix it as quickly as possible.
